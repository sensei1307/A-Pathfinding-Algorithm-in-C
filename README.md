This mini-project is a quick, basic-barebones implementation of the A* (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm in C, designed to find the shortest path between two points on an 8x8 grid using Euclidean distance as a heuristic. It demonstrates key concepts like graph traversal and cost-based search, with step-by-step visual output in the terminal.
(Code might not be readable and organised to some - as this mini-project was completed within a time constraint.)
